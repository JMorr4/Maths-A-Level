## Angles in all four quadrants

A graph can be used to find out the values of trigonometric angles. It has four quadrants, ```sin```, ```cos```, ```tan``` and ```all```. These are arranged on the graph as so:

There are a few rules when regarding angles on this graph:
- In the ```all``` quadrant, all values are positive, whereas in the ```sin``` quadrant, only sine values are postive, likewise for ```cos``` and ```tan```
- The angles begin from the ```all``` quadrant, which is marked on the diagram with a small vertical line

To find all the values of an angle, start off by working out which quadrant it fits into. We'll use ```sin(30°)``` as a visual example, which means that the ```30°``` goes into the ```all``` quadrant, so it's positive. The next angle, ```sin(120°)```, is also positive, as it fits into the ```sin``` quadrant. The next two, ```sin(210°)``` and ```sin(300°)``` are negative.

From our knowledge of exact trig values, we know that ```sin(30°) = 0.5```. The other results are as followed: 
- ```sin150° = 0.5```
- ```sin210° = -0.5```
- ```sin330° = -0.5```
