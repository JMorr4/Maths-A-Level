## Angles in all four quadrants

A graph can be used to find out the values of trigonometric angles. It has four quadrants, ```sin```, ```cos```, ```tan``` and ```all```. These are arranged on the graph as so:

There are a few rules when regarding angles on this graph:
- In the ```all``` quadrant, all values are positive, whereas in the ```sin``` quadrant, only sine values are postive, likewise for ```cos``` and ```tan```
- When finding values,
